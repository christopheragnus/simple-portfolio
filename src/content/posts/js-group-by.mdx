Return an grouped version of an array by calling `array.groupBy(fn)` on any array. A grouped array with an object where each key is the output of `fn(arr[i])` and each key is that array of items in the original array.

Consider:
 
```
Input: 
array = [
  {"id":"1"},
  {"id":"1"},
  {"id":"2"}
], 
fn = function (item) { 
  return item.id; 
}
Output: 
{ 
  "1": [{"id": "1"}, {"id": "1"}],   
  "2": [{"id": "2"}] 
}
```

To solve this, we firstly create a `tempObj` to return later.

We add the `groupBy` method to the `Array` prototype. Now, all arrays can use this method when it is invoked.

We use `this` inside the block because `this` will refer to the context in which a function is called - this would be the array 
that `groupBy` is invoked on. 

We `map` over the array, and if the key doesn't exist, we create an new array and with the individual `el` in.  Otherwise, we push `el` to an existing key returned by `fn(el)`.

```js
Array.prototype.groupBy = function(fn) {
    let tempObj = {}
    
    this.map((el) => {
        if (tempObj[fn(el)]) {
            tempObj[fn(el)].push(el)
        } else {
            tempObj[fn(el)] = [el]
        }
    } )

    return tempObj
};

/**
 * [1,2,3].groupBy(String) // {"1":[1],"2":[2],"3":[3]}
 */
```
