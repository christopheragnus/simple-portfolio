A chunked array is an array of a `size`, given an array `arr`.

A chunked array contains the original elements from `arr` with subarrays of length `size`. The last chunk can be less than the `size` if the `arr` is not evenly divisble.

To solve this, we create a `finalarr` variable to store the new array.

We create a `for` loop, starting `i=0` but increment it by `i+=size`. The block uses `slice()` to create a shallow copy of the original `arr` and then pushes each subarray of length `size` into `finalarr`. 

Then, we can still push the final subarray that is not the exact `size` because `slice()`'s second parameter `end` has the following condition on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice):

> If `end >= array.length` or `end` is omitted, array.length is used, causing all elements until the end to be extracted. 

Example 1 demonstrates the `arr` has been split into subarrays with 3 elements. However, only two elements are left for the 2nd subarray.

```js
var chunk = function(arr, size) {
    let finalarr = []
    
    for (let i=0; i < arr.length; i+=size) {
        let slicedarr = arr.slice(i, i+size);
        finalarr.push(slicedarr);
    }

    return finalarr;

};

```

Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [1,9,6,3,2], size = 3
Output: [[1,9,6],[3,2]]
```
