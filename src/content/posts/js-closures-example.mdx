In JS, functions have a reference to all variables declared in the same scope as well as in any other outer scopes. 

Consider the following:

```js
var createCounter = function(n) {
    let currentCount = n - 1;
    return function() {
        currentCount = currentCount + 1;
        return currentCount       
    };
};

/** 
 * const counter = createCounter(10)
 * counter() // 10
 * counter() // 11
 * counter() // 12
 */

```

The inner anonymous function has access to the `currentCount` variable. When the inner function is returned by `createCounter(10)`, the inner function has access to any declared variable in the same lexical environment scope.
