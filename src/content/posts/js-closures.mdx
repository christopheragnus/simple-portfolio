## How Javascript Closures work

What are Javascript Closures?

Closures are defined as: 

> Closure us when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope

Consider:

```
function foo() {
  var a = 2;
  
  function bar() {
    console.log( a );
  }

  return bar;
}

var baz = foo();

baz(); // 2 

```

Using this example, it is clear the `bar()` has lexical scope to the inner scope of `foo()`. Then we take `bar(...)` function and pass it as `a` value. We `return` the function object of the `bar` reference.

After we invoke `foo`, we assign the value of `bar()` to the variable `baz`. On the last line, where we invoke `baz()` in turn invokes `bar()`, returning `2` as a value.

Due to the closure - `bar()` is executed outside of its declared lexical scope. So instead of the inner scope of `foo()` being garbage collected, the inner scope is still in use because of the `bar()` function maintains a reference to it. Therefore, since `bar()` has a reference to the inner scope, that reference is called closure.

Like magic, closure allows the function to access the lexical scope it defined at author-time.
